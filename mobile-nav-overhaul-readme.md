# Mobile Navigation Overhaul

## Overview

This update transforms the mobile navigation and hero section into an S+ tier design that matches the sophistication of world-class sites like Apple, Stripe, and Tesla. The changes **only affect screens smaller than 768px**, ensuring the desktop experience remains unchanged.

## Features

- **Premium Mobile Menu**: Clean, modern navigation with perfect spacing and alignment
- **Optimized Dropdowns**: Each dropdown item (Services, Projects, About, Careers) is clearly tappable
- **Streamlined Layout**: Removed excessive white space for a cleaner, more efficient design
- **Full Logo Visibility**: Kansas Electric logo remains fully visible without cropping or distortion
- **Prominent CTA Button**: "POWER UP YOUR PROJECT â€“ LET'S TALK!" button is centered and highly visible
- **Refined Touch Interactions**: Subtle animations and feedback for a premium touch experience
- **Polished Hero Section**: Properly proportioned headings and content for mobile viewing

## Implementation Details

### 1. CSS Overhaul (`mobile-nav-overhaul.css`)

The CSS file implements a complete redesign of the mobile navigation:

- **Modern Navigation Header**: Clean, properly spaced header with optimized logo and menu toggle
- **Animated Hamburger Icon**: Smooth transition from hamburger to X when menu is opened
- **Full-Height Menu Panel**: Beautiful slide-in menu panel with optimized spacing
- **Elegant Dropdowns**: Accordion-style dropdowns with proper indentation and visual hierarchy
- **Premium Button Styling**: S-tier call-to-action button with proper touch feedback
- **Optimized Support Section**: More compact support section that maintains functionality
- **Refined Hero Section**: Properly sized and spaced hero section content

### 2. JavaScript Enhancements (`mobile-nav-overhaul.js`)

The JavaScript file adds sophisticated interactions for a premium feel:

- **Smooth Animations**: Elegant transitions for opening/closing menus
- **Intelligent Touch Handling**: Prevents scroll issues common in mobile menus
- **Smart Navigation Logic**: Intuitive navigation between menu levels
- **History API Integration**: Back button support for improved UX
- **Body Scroll Lock**: Prevents background content from scrolling when menu is open

### 3. Implementation Script

The PowerShell script (`add-mobile-nav-overhaul.ps1`) automatically adds these enhancements to all HTML pages:

- Adds the CSS and JavaScript files with the correct relative paths
- Positions the CSS link after other responsive CSS files
- Places the JavaScript in the optimal location for performance
- Prevents duplicate additions

## Usage

1. Run `add-mobile-nav-overhaul.bat` to apply the mobile navigation overhaul to all HTML files
2. Test the website on mobile devices to experience the premium navigation

## Technical Notes

- All styling changes are enclosed in `@media (max-width: 767px)` to preserve desktop styling
- The JavaScript only executes on mobile devices (window width < 768px)
- Uses modern CSS techniques like flexbox and transitions for smooth animations
- Implements touch-optimized interaction patterns based on mobile UX best practices

## UX Improvements
