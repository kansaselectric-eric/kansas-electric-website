# CSS Conflict Fix Implementation

## Overview

This update resolves potential conflicts between the various mobile responsive CSS files we've added to the website. It ensures that all mobile enhancements work harmoniously together without overriding each other's functionality.

## Purpose

When implementing multiple responsive CSS enhancements, there can sometimes be conflicts between selectors that target the same elements with different styling. This fix ensures:

- Form controls are properly styled with consistent margins and padding
- Checkboxes and radio buttons have consistent sizing and spacing
- Labels for form elements have proper alignment and size
- Hamburger menu styles are preserved and not overridden
- Links within paragraphs display correctly without breaking text flow

## Implementation Details

### 1. CSS Conflict Fix File (`css-conflict-fix.css`)

The CSS file contains the necessary overrides to harmonize conflicting styles:

- Resolves conflicts between `mobile-tap-targets.css` and `mobile-form-enhancements.css`
- Combines the styling intentions from both files for checkboxes and radio buttons
- Ensures submit buttons have proper styling from both tap target and form enhancements
- Fixes padding issues with inline links that might break text flow
- Ensures the hamburger menu toggle maintains its intended appearance

### 2. Implementation Script

The PowerShell script (`add-css-conflict-fix.ps1`) automatically adds the CSS file to all HTML pages:

- Adds the CSS link after other responsive CSS files
- Ensures the conflict fix is loaded last to properly override conflicting styles
- Prevents duplicate additions

## Usage

1. Run `add-css-conflict-fix.bat` to apply the CSS conflict fix to all HTML files
2. Test the website on mobile devices to verify that all elements display correctly
3. Make any additional adjustments in the `css-conflict-fix.css` file as needed

## Technical Notes

- Uses `!important` declarations to ensure overrides take precedence
- Targets very specific selectors to avoid unintended side effects
- Preserves the intended functionality of each original CSS file
- Only affects mobile views (screens under 768px) through media queries

## Benefits

- Ensures all responsive enhancements work together correctly
- Maintains consistent styling across all pages
- Prevents responsive styling bugs on mobile devices
- Provides a clean solution without modifying original CSS files
- Makes future updates easier by centralizing conflict resolutions
